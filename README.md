This Python script is used to scrap employee information from a website and put it into a CSV file.
In the website, we have a list of staff.
Each staff has their name, position and department.
The script scraps this data from each staff and puts it into a CSV file.
The CSV file can be opened in Excel, where the data has it's own dedicated column i.e. Name | Position | Department
